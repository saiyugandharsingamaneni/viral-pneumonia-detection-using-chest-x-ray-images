Pneumonia is one of the critical diseases that needs proper detection to get cured. This was originally a chest disease that was influenced by the viral effect. However, there are some other viral and chest diseases out there that resemble viral pneumonia. Thus, to get the proper treatment, the identification of viral pneumonia is essential. Deep Learning is one of the good and effective techniques that can be used to detect viral pneumonia. There have been many models that have been proposed using deep learning algorithms and pre-trained models to detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images. In this research, a deep learning model has been proposed through which the detection of viral pneumonia can be done with good accuracy and effectiveness. In this context, the chest x-ray image database has been selected on which deep learning models such as CNN2D, VGG16 and DenseNet121 have been applied. The VGG16 model has shown the properness of the detection of viral pneumonia along with the other classes in the data. Finally, the VGG16 model has been selected as the final and best model to detect viral pneumonia with 92.83% accuracy.
